cheap collision can have a filing cabnet as a rectangle instead of a more complex shape because there isnt a need.

compound colliders -
-use multiple primitives can be used to more accurently mode the shape. like an enemy or gun.
-still cheaper to run then a mesh collider.
- trades perfomormance over accuracy.
- can use different types of box's and capsule colliders to make the compound collider.

for collision detetion each sub collider in a compouind collider is still checked as per normal
complex level geomerry may also make use of compound colliders to ensure smooth experience.
props in levels can also be comprised of mulitple colliders rather then a mesh collider to ompitmate the purpose.
eg. staircases dont need to be 100% acurrate in a mesh. just use multiple boxes. or potion bottle pickup... just use a sphere.
you can use multiple rays for an ai wall detection. walk in a direction where a raycast doesnt detect a wall.


picking - 
-somethmes we would like to convert our 2d mouse coordinates into 3d for selection objects in the game world.
-we convert our 2d mouse coordinates to a 3d ray orinating from the camera position and heading.
-we can create this by a ray un-projecting a 2d point back into 3d.


humanoid locomation-
in games, our humonaoid player will instead calculate how to accelerate and de accerlate with respect to player input
-they start moving or decerlerate when we choose to stop moving
- we can do the same with rotation
-does the player move relative to the camera?
-does the input need to be transformed into world space?

the player could also be moved direction into the next step.....
in older games, the traversal of stairs could be an entire scripted sequence during which the player has no control.


Vehiculer locomtion-
grounded vehicles, such as cars or bokes may be respresented as a large collider with individual colliders for wheels
-each wheel will affect the movement of the entire vehicle


Root motion
artest can author root motion animations that directy impact the tranform information of a game object
-eg in the animation when the foot hits the ground add a forward value
