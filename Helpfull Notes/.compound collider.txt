cheap collision can have a filing cabnet as a rectangle instead of a more complex shape because there isnt a need.

compound colliders 
-use multiple primitives can be used to more accurently mode the shape. like an enemy or gun.
-still cheaper to run then a mesh collider.
- trades perfomormance over accuracy.
- can use different types of box's and capsule colliders to make the compound collider.

for collision detetion each sub collider in a compouind collider is still checked as per normal

complex level geomerry may also make use of compound colliders to ensure smooth experience.
props in levels can also be comprised of mulitple colliders rather then a mesh collider to ompitmate the purpose.
eg. staircases dont need to be 100% acurrate in a mesh. just use multiple boxes. or potion bottle pickup... just use a sphere.


you can use multiple rays for an ai wall detection. walk in a direction where a raycast doesnt detect a wall.


picking - 
-somethmes we would like to convert our 2d mouse coordinates into 3d for selection objects in the game world.
-we convert our 2d mouse coordinates to a 3d ray orinating from the camera position and heading.
-we can create this by a ray un-projecting a 2d point back into 3d.
