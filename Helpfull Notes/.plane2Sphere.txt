planes act normally as immovable wall... eg floor or walls... unity use them as static images.


becuase we know the plane is static (immovable)
- we only need to apply calcuated impuse to the sphere


example





sphere

- velocity (3, -10)


plane
-normal (-0.65, 0.75)

elasticity 1




v'a = va = - (1+e) va . n * n

v'a = (3, -10) - (1 + 1) x  (3, -10) . (-0.65, 0.75) *  (-0.65, 0.75)
