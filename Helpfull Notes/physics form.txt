physic Notes!!!

momentum as a product of mass and velocity
p = mv

p = momentum
m = mass
v = velocity

momentum can be seen as the "total amount of pushing" required to stop and object

the momemtum of a system is a constant unless an external forces act on that system.... an item will travel forever until gravity stops it...etc

kinda collision maths
- sphere 1
p = p1 + m1v1
- sphere 2
p = p2 + m2v2

- collisions will become
p = p1 + p2 = m1v1 + m2v2

Resolving a collision: Collision normal

choosing a normal can be tricky
the collision noramal may be supploed by the collisin
(posb - posa)


the velocity of a after the collision is 
v1 a = va + j/ma.n

vollision resolvution for spheres
normalise the vecter 
b-A

quiz
- cue ball 1 
speed  =  11.11 /ms (40km/hr)
weight 170g 

- cue ball 2
160g weight

elasticity 1
normal is (-1, 0 )


j = -1831.46666667

v'(ball1) = 11.11 + -1831.4666 / 170 x 1 = 0.33667058823
v'(ball2) = 0 - -1831.4666 / 160 x 1 = 11.44666625

//sollution for above
va = va + j/ma n
v'b = vb - j / mb n
